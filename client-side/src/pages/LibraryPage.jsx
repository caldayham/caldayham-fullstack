        My hope is that this system of "actions, thoughts, and experiences"
        allows any piece of data that could ever be linked to myself to fall
        nicely into one of these categories.
        <br /> One way I test this theory is to think of random items and then
        determine if they would fit nicely into one of these three categories.
        <br /> So far it has held up nicely -{" "}
        <i>let me know if you think of something though </i>- but let me pose a
        question I asked myself.
        <br /> Where would an image of me dressed up for haloween when I was 6
        go?
        <br /> It could be under actions because I acted on my environment to
        prepare for that haloween, could be thoughts because I'm sure there was
        lots going on in my head when the photo was taken, could be experiences
        because I was being acted upon by my environment.
        <br /> I don't think this is a breaking item, I think, in a perfect
        world, it would be filed, or at least refenced, under each category.
        <br /> That said I am not about to go breaking down every image, video,
        story, or multi-component media that I would like to make available
        here.
        <br /> So things like that will be posted here, in the library.
